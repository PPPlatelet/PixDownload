# PixDownload

## A Hardmode Pixiv Downloader  (It'll be soon optimized.) :)

### Operating Guide:

1. Ensure you have a Windows/Linux environment.
2. Set up a Python IDE.
3. Create a **run.bat** file and input the following commands:

    ```batch
    pip install --ignore-installed -i ("A reliable mirror URL") --trusted-host ("A trusted host") --target=("Your Python path if you have 2 or more Python environments") -r requirements.txt
    python PixDownload.py    
    pause     
    ```

4. Execute the **run.bat** file to open the program. If you don't want to run `pip` every time, then delete the **first** line in the batch file.
5. Enter the Pixiv tag and press **Enter**. Repeat this process for additional tags until you press "Q" or "q". Ensure you have a **VPN** and it's actived.
6. Wait until the download completes.
7. Your pictures will be found at `(programroot)/pixiv/`.
8. Enjoy!

Make sure to adjust paths and settings as necessary for your environment.
